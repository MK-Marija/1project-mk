# Northcoders News API


Here are the instructions for my first project: 

Clone the repo https://github.com/MK-Marija/1project-mk.git 

Once you have done that it's time to create two .env files. 

1  In the  .env.development file type in PGDATABASE=nc_news and 
2           .env.test file type in PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
